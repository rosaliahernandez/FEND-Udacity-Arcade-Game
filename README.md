## How to play
This arcade game consists of a player and several "enemies" which are the lady bugs running through the screen. The object of the game is to move your player from the grass squares to the water squares without running into any of the enemies. If you player collides with the enemy, the game will restart which means your player is moved back to the grass squares. Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to mobilize your player.
